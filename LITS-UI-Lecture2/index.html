		You may well ask: &ldquo;How can I start using <abbr>HTML5</abbr> if older browsers don&rsquo;t support it?&rdquo; But the question itself is misleading. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is not one big thing; it is a collection of individual features. So you can&rsquo;t detect &ldquo;<abbr>HTML5</abbr> support,&rdquo; because that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. But you <em>can</em> detect support for individual features, like canvas, video, or geolocation.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may think of <abbr>HTML</abbr> as tags and angle brackets. That&rsquo;s an important part of it, but it&rsquo;s not the whole story. The <abbr>HTML5</abbr> specification also defines how those angle brackets interact with JavaScript, through the Document Object Model (<abbr>DOM</abbr>). <abbr>HTML5</abbr> doesn&rsquo;t just define a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag; there is also a corresponding <abbr>DOM</abbr> <abbr>API</abbr> for video objects in the <abbr>DOM</abbr>. You can use this <abbr>API</abbr> to detect support for different video formats, play a video, pause, mute audio, track how much of the video has been downloaded, and everything else you need to build a rich user experience around the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="detect.html">Chapter 2</a> and <a href="everything.html">Appendix A</a> will teach you how to properly detect support for each new <abbr>HTML5</abbr> feature.

	<h2 id="two">2. You don&rsquo;t need to throw anything away</h2>

	<img src="i/forms.png" alt="[sample form controls]" width="134" height="196" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">
	<p>
		Love it or hate it, you can&rsquo;t deny that <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4 is the most successful markup format ever. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> builds on that success. You don&rsquo;t need to throw away your existing markup. You don&rsquo;t need to relearn things you already know. If your web application worked yesterday in <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, it will still work today in <abbr>HTML5</abbr>. Period.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, if you want to <em>improve</em> your web applications, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Here&rsquo;s a concrete example: <abbr>HTML5</abbr> supports all the form controls from <abbr>HTML</abbr> 4, but it also includes new input controls. Some of these are long-overdue additions like sliders and date pickers; others are more subtle. For example, the <code>email</code> input type looks just like a text box, but mobile browsers will customize their onscreen keyboard to make it easier to type email addresses. Older browsers that don&rsquo;t support the <code>email</code> input type will treat it as a regular text field, and the form still works with no markup changes or scripting hacks. This means you can start improving your web forms <em>today</em>, even if some of your visitors are stuck on IE 6.
	</p>
	<p>
		Read all the gory details about <abbr>HTML5</abbr> forms in <a href="forms.html">Chapter 9</a>.

	<h2 id="three">3. It&rsquo;s easy to get started</h2>

	<img src="i/markup-with-arrow.png" alt="[sample HTML markup]" width="234" height="202" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">
	<p>
		&ldquo;Upgrading&rdquo; to <abbr>HTML5</abbr> can be as simple as changing your <i>doctype</i>. The doctype should already be on the first line of every <abbr>HTML</abbr> page. Previous versions of <abbr>HTML</abbr> defined a lot of doctypes, and choosing the right one could be tricky. In <abbr>HTML5</abbr>, there is only one doctype:

			<blockquote>
				<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
			</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>
		Upgrading to the <abbr>HTML5</abbr> doctype won&rsquo;t break your existing markup, because <a rel="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/#absent-elements" target="_blank">obsolete elements</a> previously defined in HTML 4 will still render in <abbr>HTML5</abbr>. But it will allow you to use &mdash; and validate &mdash; new semantic elements like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. You&rsquo;ll learn all about these new elements in <a href="semantics.html">Chapter 3</a>.

	<h2 id="four">4. It already works</h2>

	<img src="i/rel-email.png" alt="[form field with onscreen keyboard]" width="227" height="192" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">
	<p>
		Whether you want to draw on a canvas, play video, design better forms, or build web applications that work offline, you&rsquo;ll find that <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is already well-supported. Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and mobile browsers already support canvas (<a href="canvas.html">Chapter 4</a>), video (<a href="video.html">Chapter 5</a>), geolocation (<a href="geolocation.html">Chapter 6</a>), local storage (<a href="storage.html">Chapter 7</a>), and more. Google already supports microdata annotations (<a href="extensibility.html">Chapter 10</a>). Even Microsoft &mdash; rarely known for blazing the trail of standards support &mdash; supports most <abbr>HTML5</abbr> features in Internet Explorer 9.

	<p>
		Each chapter of this book includes the all-too-familiar browser compatibility charts. But more importantly, each chapter includes a frank discussion of your options if you need to support older browsers. <abbr>HTML5</abbr> features like geolocation (<a href="geolocation.html">Chapter 6</a>) and video (<a href="video.html">Chapter 5</a>) were first provided by browser plugins like Gears or Flash. Other features, like canvas (<a href="canvas.html">Chapter 4</a>), can be emulated entirely in JavaScript. This book will teach you how to target the native features of modern browsers, without leaving older browsers behind.

		Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in the early 1990s. He later founded the <abbr>W3C</abbr> to act as a steward of web standards, which the organization has done for more than 15 years. Here is what the <abbr>W3C</abbr> had to say about the future of web standards, in July 2009:

		<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/News/2009#item119">
			Today the Director announces that when the <abbr>XHTML</abbr> 2 Working Group charter expires as scheduled at the end of 2009, the charter will not be renewed. By doing so, and by increasing resources in the <abbr>HTML</abbr> Working Group, <abbr>W3C</abbr> hopes to accelerate the progress of <abbr>HTML5</abbr> and clarify <abbr>W3C</abbr>&rsquo;s position regarding the future of <abbr>HTML</abbr>.
